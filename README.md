<!-- You are an expert python developer. I am planning to build a generic python DML tool with following requirements:
1. DML tool should be an UI application where user should be able to put the DML statement and selected the Database (DEV, UAT, PROD) and selected schemas where it should run.
2. Once submitted the request will go through approval workflow. Manager will have ability to review the script and either approve/reject with comments.
3. Once manager approval is done, the request will be sent to Production Support team for next level of Approval.
4. once the production support approves then then DML statement will run in the selected environment.
5. The Status should be updated in each stage of the workflow.
6. We should also capture the requestor, approver and production support user who are involved in this process.
7. Use streamlit package for the UI. -->
